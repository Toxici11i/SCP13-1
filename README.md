### Hosting a Server

If you want to host a test server on this code, or generally want to host one you can approach that with 2 methods, the first is taking the old route, cloning this code and compiling it yourself, then running it.

The second method would be downloading the latest Docker image that passed on [this](https://hub.docker.com/r/ss13scp13/ss13-scp13/tags) site, all of the latest images are there. Alternatively you can use `docker pull ss13scp13/ss13-scp13` from the command line to pull the image.
